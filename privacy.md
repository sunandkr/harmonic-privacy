  Harmonic ("we", "our", or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains how we handle your 
  information.                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                        
  ## Data Collection & Storage

  **Your data is yours.** Harmonic stores your check-ins, recovery activities, burnout scores, and preferences locally
  on your device using Apple's on-device storage.

  If you have iCloud enabled, your data is optionally synced to your private iCloud account via Apple's CloudKit. This
  sync is between your own devices only — we never have access to your iCloud data. You can disable iCloud sync at any
  time in the app's settings without affecting functionality.

  ## Apple HealthKit

  With your explicit permission, Harmonic can read the following data from Apple HealthKit:

  - **Sleep data** — to auto-fill your sleep hours during check-in
  - **Workout data** — to automatically match completed workouts with your recovery activities

  Harmonic only reads this data — we never write to HealthKit. HealthKit access is entirely optional and the app
  functions fully without it.

  **In accordance with Apple's requirements, HealthKit data is:**
  - Never sold, shared with, or disclosed to third parties
  - Never used for advertising or marketing purposes
  - Used solely to provide app functionality as described above

  ## On-Device AI

  On supported devices, Harmonic uses Apple's on-device language model to generate personalized wellness
  recommendations. All AI processing happens locally on your device. No data is sent to Apple or any external server for
   this purpose.

  ## Third-Party Services

  Harmonic uses the Nager.Date API solely to fetch public holiday information for your selected country. Only your
  country code and year are sent — no personal data is shared with this service.

  ## Notifications

  All notifications are scheduled locally on your device. No notification data is sent to external servers.

  ## Data We Do NOT Collect

  - Location data
  - Contacts, photos, or media
  - Usage analytics or telemetry
  - Advertising identifiers
  - Device identifiers
  - Account credentials or payment information

  ## Your Control

  - **iCloud sync** can be toggled off in Settings
  - **HealthKit access** can be revoked in Settings or in the iOS Health app
  - **All app data** can be deleted from within the app's settings, or by uninstalling the app. If iCloud sync is
  enabled, uninstalling also removes data from iCloud.

  ## Children's Privacy

  Harmonic does not knowingly collect information from children under 13.

  ## Changes to This Policy

  We may update this policy occasionally. Continued use of the app constitutes acceptance of any changes.
